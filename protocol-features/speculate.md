# ðŸŽ† Speculate



Stake your STK, and every minute your balance will increase by a certain percentage However, at a randomly chosen minute, the protocol will burn 90% of all the money being staked. So, your goal is to speculate on when the burn will take place, between the next 1-60 minutes. Type in the amount you want to speculate on, and the graph will update, showing at each minute the possible earnings. Here are the rules of speculating:

1. Every minute that passes, the 1-minute APY will increase, so the possible earnings increase exponentially.
2. The number of coins rewarded will be minted by the protocol.
3. If the minute guessed is wrong, then 90% of the speculated STK will be given away: 80% will be burned, 10% will be given to the protocol for marketing and expenses
4. A user can speculate once per hour
