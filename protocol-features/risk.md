# âœ³ Risk

&#x20;

Risk your coins and once a day your balance will change, either minting to your risk balance or burning from it. Listed below are the rules:

#### Positive Outcomes:

* 50% chance of gaining 1%
* 10% chance of gaining 10%
* 1% chance of gaining 100% (doubling your coins)

#### Negative Outcomes

* 5% chance of losing 10%
* 1% chance of losing 30%
* 0.1% chance of losing 90%

1. &#x20;Any combination of these outcomes can happen at the same time, i.e., you can gain both 1% and lose 5% at the same time.
2. &#x20;All percentages gained or lost will be based on the risk balance. So, let's say you risk 100 STK. You get lucky and gain both 1% and 10%. The amount added would be 1 and 10 coins. Your new balance would be 111 coins
3. 90% of the losses will be burned (given to the 0x address) while 10% will be given to a general wallet for the protocol, being used to pay for expenses and marketing
4. Before the 24 hours are passed, if a user tries to risk more STK, the timer will reset, and the user will need to wait another 24 hours
5. After the 24 hours, if you want to risk again without adding anymore STK, type "0" into the input and click the risk button
