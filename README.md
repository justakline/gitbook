# Stake Game

Stake Game, at its barebones, is a staking protocol similar to an Olympus Dao fork. However, we have seen the shortcomings of Olympus, Wonderland, Klima, etc., and provide a way to not make the same mistakes, particularly when it comes to price action. We are **NOT** **a reserve currency protocol** and do not plan to be. We are using the Olympus Dao framework to provide a profit with the user's risk tolerance.

### **What makes us different from other Olympus Forks?**

Olympus and Wonderland promised thousands of percent APY, and while they have given it out in terms of their own currency, the prices have fallen over 90%, effectively making it ROI worthless. The problem with these protocols is that the staking feature is only inflationary, meaning that do not have any way of removing the supply resulting in an ever-decreasing price.

Stake Game has both inflationary and deflationary features; inflationary when it comes to the staking mechanisms, and deflationary when it comes to our burning mechanisms that are risk-based for the user. Each one is explained later on.
